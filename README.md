GDJ
===

The GDJ project aims to extend [gdipp] for the modern world. So here
the name goes &ndash; Gdi32 and DirectWrite Jammer (I've just made this up).
As what you may have been quite familiar with now, GDJ allows you to
replace the rasterizers with your favourite ones:

* FreeType2
* GGO
* DirectWrite

FreeType is probably the most noticable one &ndash; you can plug in your own
LCD filters, mess around with all kinds of custom settings. You know,
freedom is cool.

About This Project
------------------

The name GDJ is simply [gdi++][gdipp] evaluated in a wrong way.
If you haven't got the joke yet, try xkcd "[types][xkcd-1537]". 

  [gdipp]: https://code.google.com/archive/p/gdipp/
  [xkcd-1537]:https://xkcd.com/1537/

This project is likely to be a forever work-in-progress. I amcreating
the repo solely for my great idea (huh?) about the name, and for having
somewhere on the web to read the code highlighted, and potentially
better structured in places like sourcegraph.
Don't even expect class or dll name changes -- unnecessary changesets
aren't interesting at all.

(I am planning to rename gdimm to gdh. Hâ€¦ Hunter?)
